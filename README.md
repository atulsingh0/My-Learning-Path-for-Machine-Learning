I am newbie in Machine Learning but working with data a lot as an ETL developer. I simply fall for ML when I've first introduced with it, so I have given a target date to myself to complete the below learning schedule with my day to day work :-)

Hoping I am not too harsh on my self.

Let's not do the talking but the work :


### Python
For beginners, I will suggest below reference material which can help them learning python quickly
- [ ] [BOOK - Python for Informatics](www.pythonlearn.com/book_007.pdf)
- [ ] [Course - Programming for Everybody by University of Michigan] (https://www.coursera.org/learn/python)

These 2 source are more than enough to learn basics of python.

- [ ] [10 minutes to pands] (http://pandas.pydata.org/pandas-docs/stable/10min.html#min)
- [ ] [pandas turorials] (http://pandas.pydata.org/pandas-docs/stable/tutorials.html)
- [ ] [Some tutorials on my Site] (http://www.datagenx.net/search/label/Pandas)





### Machine Learning Books
